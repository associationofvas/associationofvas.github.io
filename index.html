We plan to create, with your help, a VA certification that matters and is widely recognized to make sure clients can tell you apart from the rest.</p>

        <h4 style="color:#BD9128">Q. Why do industry standards matter?</h4>
        <p>a. A world without industry standards would mean chaos. From minimum safety standards when building homes, to how we put gas in our vehicles, the outlet plugs we use, and even how we are affected by time zones. VAs may not run the world yet, but think of how often and how much of your times is spent educating clients on the industry of virtual assistants. I know this first hand and have written two books and recently revised my first book, Hire the Right Virtual Assistant, to include industry standards.</p>

        <h4 style="color:#BD9128">Q. Why do clients care about industry standards?</h4>
        <p>a. In our research, we found that a major factor for clients not hiring a virtual assistant was not solely based on price - it was based on the fact they could not verify if what they were paying was reasonable in comparison to other VAs. Imagine yourself as a consumer and trying to make a purchase without any knowledge of the market. Would you make a significant purchase, one with lasting impact on your business (which has a direct impact on your lifestyle) without doing some research? Your future clients are savvy consumers and will gladly pay you your worth if they know they are not overpaying.</p>

        <h4 style="color:#BD9128">Q. How do industry standards protect VAs?</h4>
        <p>a. It’s like instating a minimum wage act. However, the real benefit is to maximize the reliability of service and those standards.</p>

        <h4 style="color:#BD9128">Q. What kind of future benefits does the AVA imagine?</h4>
        <p>a. The future development of new services offered by VAs. Along with new services comes new pricing and the need to be promoted to increase awareness which we will do, as well as communicating the latest industry and market trends.</p>

        <h4 style="color:#BD9128">Q. What if my services are priced above industry standards?</h4>
        <p>a. Great! The AVA will work with you to have your VA Elite skills and abilities stand out from the competition. However, if the client doesn’t have a base of industry standards how would he/she know that they were receiving elite service? We’ll make sure that you are recognizable.</p>

        <h4 style="color:#BD9128">Q. Do Virtual Assistants really need an association to advocate on their behalf?</h4>
        <p>a. Yes! As the industry faces new challenges and incredible opportunities the standards, from pricing to protocol, and procedure must be tested and updated. This provides protection and may even require laws to be passed. Something the Association of Virtual Assistants is committed to. Traditional in-person assistants have their associations, now you have yours!</p>

        <h4 style="color:#BD9128">Q. I’m already a part of several VA groups. How is this different?</h4>
        <p>a. For starters, this is not a group. Rather an association. The group you are a part of at the moment is most likely defined by a single VA. The group may have his/her trademarked methodology or service system as an added benefit. The purpose of the Association of Virtual Assistants is not to form a group around any one person’s ideas or objectives. The AVA is committed to serving the industry as a whole and in unity. While we will do everything we can to support your personal and professional development this is about future-proofing an entire industry. Something that no one else and no group is addressing.</p>

        <h4 style="color:#BD9128">Q. Why should I care about the future of virtual assistants?</h4>
        <p>a. Being an assistant is a calling and a privilege. As VAs we get to live the best of both worlds by serving and enjoying freedom and flexibility. It is a field many are entering and  more easily than ever before thanks to all those who paved the way before us. It should be our duty and calling to also provide a trusted resource for those virtual assistants entering the field daily, as well as those in the future. The AVA will be a trusted resource for the virtual assistants of today, tomorrow, and the future. Be a part of the industry standards now and in the future by joining the Association of Virtual Assistants.</p>
